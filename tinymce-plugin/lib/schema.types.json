It represents an information update made by a\n      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,\n      local government.<br/><br/>\n\nFor work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#\">this doc</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic\">Coronavirus pandemic</a>, and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\nexpect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our\nusual <a href=\"https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490\">Github entry</a>, feedback comments can also be provided in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#\">this document</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol\">CAP</a>, although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\nthe kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.<br/><br/>\n\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:<br/><br/>\n\nWe encourage the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires\" (if appropriate), \"category\" and\n\"url\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for \"category\" where possible, most ideally as a well known\nURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\".<br/><br/>\n\nFor many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/WebContent\">WebContent</a> type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \"<a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/text\">text</a>\" summary of the page. It is\nunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.<br/><br/>\n\nWe expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/openingHours\">openingHours</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/Event\">Event</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/FAQPage\">FAQPage</a> etc. By linking to those pages from a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a> you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/category\">category</a> property of the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nMany <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a>s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/spatialCoverage\">spatialCoverage</a> for the region, and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/announcementLocation\">announcementLocation</a> to indicate specific <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/LocalBusiness\">LocalBusiness</a>es and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/CivicStructure\">CivicStructure</a>s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/spatialCoverage\">spatialCoverage</a> and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/announcementLocation\">announcementLocation</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nThe <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/about\">about</a> property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/about\">about</a> only\nfor representing non-location entities (e.g. a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/Course\">Course</a> or a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/RadioStation\">RadioStation</a>). For places, use <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/announcementLocation\">announcementLocation</a> and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/spatialCoverage\">spatialCoverage</a>. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of /about for locations too.<br/><br/>\n\nThe basic content of <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a> is similar to that of an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)\">Atom</a> feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting\n<a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement\">SpecialAnnouncement</a> updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\nwith the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/webFeed\">webFeed</a> property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/DataFeed\">DataFeed</a> object, with <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/encodingFormat\">encodingFormat</a> providing\nmedia type information e.g. \"application/rss+xml\" or \"application/atom+xml\"." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/Specialty", "label": "Specialty", "comment": "Any branch of a field in which people typically develop specific expertise, usually after significant study, time, and effort." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/SpeechPathology", "label": "SpeechPathology", "comment": "The scientific study and treatment of defects, disorders, and malfunctions of speech and voice, as stuttering, lisping, or lalling, and of language disturbances, as aphasia or delayed language acquisition." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/SpokenWordAlbum", "label": "SpokenWordAlbum", "comment": "SpokenWordAlbum." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/SportingGoodsStore", "label": "SportingGoodsStore", "comment": "A sporting goods store." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/SportsActivityLocation", "label": "SportsActivityLocation", "comment": "A sports location, such as a playing field." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/SportsClub", "label": "SportsClub", "comment": "A sports club." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/SportsEvent", "label": "SportsEvent", "comment": "Event type: Sports event." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/SportsOrganization", "label": "SportsOrganization", "comment": "Represents the collection of all sports organizations, including sports teams, governing bodies, and sports associations." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/SportsTeam", "label": "SportsTeam", "comment": "Organization: Sports team." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/SpreadsheetDigitalDocument", "label": "SpreadsheetDigitalDocument", "comment": "A spreadsheet file." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/StadiumOrArena", "label": "StadiumOrArena", "comment": "A stadium." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/StagedContent", "label": "StagedContent", "comment": "Content coded 'staged content' in a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/MediaReview\">MediaReview</a>, considered in the context of how it was published or shared.<br/><br/>\n\nFor a <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/VideoObject\">VideoObject</a> to be 'staged content': A video that has been created using actors or similarly contrived.<br/><br/>\n\nFor an <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\">ImageObject</a> to be 'staged content': An image that was created using actors or similarly contrived, such as a screenshot of a fake tweet.<br/><br/>\n\nFor an <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/ImageObject\">ImageObject</a> with embedded text to be 'staged content': An image that was created using actors or similarly contrived, such as a screenshot of a fake tweet.<br/><br/>\n\nFor an <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"https://schema.org/AudioObject\">AudioObject</a> to be 'staged content': Audio that has been created using actors or similarly contrived." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/StagesHealthAspect", "label": "StagesHealthAspect", "comment": "Stages that can be observed from a topic." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/State", "label": "State", "comment": "A state or province of a country." }, { "value": "https://schema.org/Statement", "label": "Statement", "comment": "A statement about something, for example a fun or interesting fact.

For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible.
